# Sccm-ApplicationPackaging-PowerShell
A collection of SCCM application packaging recipes with template, a How-To Guide, and PowerShell install and uninstall programs.

My collection of application packaging documentation with PowerShell install and uninstall programs developed for use with System Center Configuration Manager 2012 R2.

PDF documentation is included for each packaged application. Many of the techniques used are still relevant. The configuration settings for products like Acrobat are typical for a large enterprise organization spread across multiple locations. Files have been sanitized of any specific company references for security and privacy.
