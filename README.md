# Sccm-ApplicationPackaging-PowerShell
A collection of SCCM application packaging recipes with template, a How-To Guide, and PowerShell install and uninstall program.

My collection of application packaging documentation with PowerShell install and uninstall programs developed for use with System Center Configuration Manager 2012 R2.

PDF documentation is included for each packaged application. Many of the techniques used are still relevant. The configuration settings for products like Acrobat are typical for a large enterprise organization spread across multiple locations. Files have been sanitized of any specific company references for security and privacy.

_SCCM_Application_Packaging_How-To_Guide.pdf --> Describes the application packaging process and provides a summary of PowerShell techniques used.

_SCCM_Packaged_Apps_Categories.pdf --> A complete list of all applications packaged for SCCM distribution (my to-do list is highlighted in yellow)

_Application_Packaging_Dependency_Map.pdf --> A PDF version of the spreadsheet used to track software dependencies between installed application packages

_Application_Packaging_Template.pdf --> The application packaging template for tracking all the necessary information to package any application for SCCM distribution
